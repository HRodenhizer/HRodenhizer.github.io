I am a Postdoctoral Researcher on the [Permafrost Pathways](https://permafrost.woodwellclimate.org/) project at [Woodwell Climate Research Center](https://www.woodwellclimate.org/). I study the impact that climate change is having on Arctic ecosystems, and the role that carbon emissions from Arctic ecosystems will have in exacerbating climate change. I use remote sensing, GIS, eddy covariance, and chamber based carbon flux measurements in this work, and I particularly like analyzing and visualizing the results. Check out some [cool permafrost maps, gifs, and figures]({% post_url 2021-11-21-PhD-Research %}) I made in R as a part of my PhD in the [Schuur Lab](https://www2.nau.edu/schuurlab-p/) at Northern Arizona University.
