What is permafrost?
======
Permafrost is soil found primarily in the Arctic that has been frozen for at least two consecutive years (but often much longer - on the order of thousands of years). Like putting chicken in the freezer, organic carbon from dead animals and plants cannot decompose in permafrost. This means that over thousands of years, permafrost soils have accumulated approximately twice as much carbon as is currently in the atmosphere<sup>1,2</sup>. At the same time, permafrost can be mostly ice by volume, meaning that ice provides structural support for these soils. However, air temperatures are rising 2-3 times as fast in the Arctic as the global average, causing permafrost to thaw<sup>1</sup>. When permafrost thaws, the loss of ice volume within the soil causes the ground to subside, sometimes very rapidly, in a process either known as abrupt thaw or thermokarst<sup>3</sup>. Abrupt thaw can cause permafrost to thaw even more quickly by exposing soils directly to the surface (among other processes), and, like taking chicken out of freezer, this means that thawing organic carbon can be decomposed and released to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. The greenhouse gases released from permafrost will contribute to additional climate change beyond than that which is directly caused by the burning of fossil fuels<sup>1</sup>.

The Experiment
======
To investigate these issues, the Schuur lab started the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research (CiPEHR) in 2009 to experimentally warm permafrost soils and track the changes in the ecosystem (Fig 1). I was lucky enough to join the lab as a PhD student in 2016 and began focusing on ground subsidence and carbon release.

Figure 1. The Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Research (CiPEHR) site is located near Healy, AK. Air and soil warming is applied at three replicate experimental blocks. Carbon release and uptake are measured in each plot and at an eddy covariance tower located about 1 km from the experiment. Latitude and longitude are provided in UTM zone 6N. The three block insets show the treatment and location of plots over high-resolution aerial photographs available from [NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/). The solid black lines show the location of snow fences (used to apply soil warming) and the dashed lines indicate the extent of GPS surveying. The inset at bottom left shows the location within Alaska. This figure was created using ggplot2 and ggmap in R and is published in Rodenhizer et al.<sup>4</sup>

Subsidence and Permafrost Thaw
======
Permafrost thaw is typically measured by inserting a metal probe into the ground until it hits permafrost. This metric, called active layer thickness, assumes that the soil surface elevation has not changed. Using GPS derived elevation data in combination with ALT, I could explicitly account for subsidence in my measure of permafrost thaw.

I found that control plots which received no soil warming subsided an average of over 10 cm over 9 years and warming plots subsided an average of nearly 50 cm over the same time frame (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Accounting for subsidence, permafrost thawed between 19% (control) and 49% (warming) deeper than active layer thickness indicated (Fig. 4), and the rate of carbon thaw was between 37% (control) and 113% (warming) greater. Additionally, deeply subsided areas became very wet, killing off most of the plants in several plots (Fig. 4, Fig. 5).

Figure 2. Total subsidence between 2009 and 2020 at the three experimental blocks at CiPEHR. The black lines show the location of the snow fences, with control plots below and right of the snow fences and soil warming plots above and left. This figure is a simplified and updated version of a Fig. 3 in Rodenhizer et al.<sup>4</sup>, and was created using ggplot2 and ggpubr in R.

Figure 4. The average soil profile in control and soil warming plots. The active layer (seasonally thawed surface layer of soil) is the layer of soil between the ground surface and the permafrost surface, both shown as bold lines. The unsaturated portion of the active layer (above the water table) is shown in brown, and the saturated portion of the active layer (below the water table) is shown in blue. Permafrost is shown in gray. The original soil surface is indicated with the dashed line, and the change in the soil surface (upper bold line) reflects subsidence. The dotted line shows the active layer thickness assuming no subsidence, while the top of the permafrost table has actually thawed much more deeply. Gray error bars indicate standard error of measurements. This figure was created using ggplot2 in R and is published in Rodenhizer et al.<sup>4</sup>

Figure 5. The deeply subsided warming plots in block B were so wet by 2018 that much of the vegetation had died.

But does subsidence in the experiment actually reflect what’s occurring more broadly?
======
After completing the work on subsidence at an experimental warming site, I wanted to find out how extensive subsidence was across the entire landscape (without experimental warming). Additionally, I wanted to know whether the carbon that was being thawed especially quickly in areas undergoing subsidence would be subsequently released to the atmosphere. For this project, I needed data at a larger scale, so I turned to airborne LiDAR-derived elevation data provided by the National Ecological Observatory Network ([NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/)), which allowed me to study a 9x9 km area at 1 m resolution. Combining field data with airborne data, I would be able to investigate a larger extent and relate this to what I knew from collecting data in a much smaller area (Fig. 6).

Figure 6. Combining data across scales, from field measurements to satellite based remote sensing, improves understanding of large-scale phenomena by incorporating mechanistic knowledge derived from field studies with landscape-scale trends detectable only in remote sensing data. I created this visual using ArcGIS and Photoshop as a part of a remote sensing fusion internship with NASA ABoVE (Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment).

My goal for this project was to identify thermokarst pits and gullies (both forms of abrupt thaw) by identifying elevation minima in the NEON elevation data set. I wrote an algorithm that compares the elevation of every cell in the elevation raster to the median elevation in a neighborhood around that cell. If the elevation falls below the median elevation, it is considered a thermokarst cell, if it is equal to or higher than the median elevation, it is not considered thermokarst (Fig. 7). When applied across the entire study area, I found that 7% of the landscape is classified as thermokarst (with 71.5% accuracy), meaning that abrupt thaw is already widespread due to climate change, but that certain areas are more susceptible to thermokarst than others (Fig. 8). Additionally, these thermokarst features showed higher carbon dioxide and methane release, despite the fact that they also had higher plant growth. This means that abrupt thaw is likely to exacerbate carbon emissions from permafrost ecosystems in the future.

Figure 7. A conceptual diagram of the thermokarst detection algorithm (black), which is available as an [R package](https://github.com/HRodenhizer/thermokarstdetection), with a site-specific filter to remove non-thermokarst landscape features (light gray) and final processing steps (dark gray), neither of which are included in the R package. As part of the R package, 1) median elevation is calculated for each cell of a DTM using a moving circular neighborhood, 2) microtopography is calculated by subtracting the median elevation from the DTM, and 3) elevation minima are classified as microtopography values below 0 cm. As part of the post-processing not included in the R package, 1) steep slopes, deeply incised rivers, and non-thermokarst lakes were filtered out from the elevation minima, 2) combinations of thermokarst classifications were created to determine the best combination of neighborhood size and threshold value to detect different thermokarst sizes and, 3) the best classification was converted to vector format for analysis. This figure was created using the DiagrammeR package in R, to aid readers in understanding the methods of this project and is in preparation for publication<sup>5</sup>.

Figure 8. A) The mean depth of thermokarst features (2017-2019) across the study extent (9 x 9 km black box). The EML watershed is outlined in black with the EC tower and approximate tower footprint shown as a point within a circle. The three gray points show the location of the three experimental blocks at CiPEHR. Colored squares indicate insets shown in B-D.  B) This inset shows largest thermokarst pond we identified in one of the most heavily thermokarst affected areas within the study extent. In addition to naturally formed features, dogsled/ATV tracks are visible throughout the area. 26% of the inset was classified as thermokarst.  C) This inset shows thaw ponds and water tracks which drain into EML surrounding the EC tower. 19% of the inset was classified as thermokarst.  D) This inset shows extensive small thermokarst pits on the terminal moraine East of EML (the greener, shrubby area), dogsled/ATV tracks, and thermokarst pits caused by soil warming at CiPEHR. 11% of the inset was classified as thermokarst. This figure was created using ggplot2 and ggpubr in R and is in preparation for publication<sup>5</sup>.

One major question about abrupt thaw is what will happen to soil hydrologic conditions following abrupt thaw and how that will shift both the magnitude of carbon release from permafrost ecosystems and the relative contributions of carbon dioxide and methane to emissions. To investigate the response of soil hydrologic conditions to abrupt thaw, I looked at elevation, water table depth, and permafrost table during dry and wet periods along transects spanning relatively high elevations to deeply subsided areas. I found that deeply subsided areas tend to be wet all the time, regardless of whether or not it has rained recently, while adjacent, higher elevation areas are much more variable in response to rain (Fig. 9). 

![](/images/wtd_transects.jpg)
Figure 9. Elevation (normalized to the highest elevation along each transect), water table depth, and permafrost table along six replicate transects from local high spots in control plots to local low spots in soil warming plots. The right most column shows the change in water table depth from dry conditions (almost no rain for a month) to wet conditions a few weeks later (~1/3 of annual rainfall in two weeks). Less change to water table depth in subsided areas following a large precipitation event indicates that water can drain into these depressions, keeping them consistently wet. This figure was created using ggplot2 and ggpubr in R and is in preparation for publication<sup>6</sup>.

Carbon Emissions from Permafrost
======
We know that permafrost thaw is likely to lead to carbon emissions similar in magnitude to the emissions from some of the world’s highest carbon emitting countries, but whether that carbon is released as carbon dioxide or methane is very important (Fig. 10, Fig. 11). This is because methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas. This means that a small amount of methane release can cause a lot more warming than the same amount of carbon dioxide. How hydrology responds to abrupt thaw in permafrost environments will determine the amount of carbon that is released as carbon dioxide vs. methane, because methane is primarily produced in saturated conditions lacking oxygen, while carbon dioxide is primarily produced in drier conditions. If abrupt thaw leads to wetter soils in the long-term, this could mean higher methane release, but if soils dry out in the long-term, carbon dioxide release could increase drastically. Both conditions will make it harder to stay below 1.5°C warming globally.

Figure 10. Nine example scenarios for cumulative projected greenhouse gas emissions from permafrostbased on three levels (low, medium, high) of net carbon dioxide and net methane emissions to the atmosphere for 2000-2099. Axes represent cumulative net mass of carbon (petagrams) released to the atmosphere as either carbon dioxide or methane. The color scale is the total greenhouse gas warming potential of carbon dioxide and methane together, in units of carbon dioxide equivalent (petagrams C) with the weighting of methane relative to carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide equivalent is also compared to extrapolated 2019 country-level carbon emissions for several representative nations. The pie-graphs show the relative contribution of carbon dioxide and methane to the total carbon dioxide equivalent.The size of the pie-graph symbols on the graph is equivalent to the total carbon dioxide equivalent for each scenario, which is also reported under each pie-graph. This figure was created in collaboration with Ted Schuur, who provided the data and general idea, and Victor Leshyk, who provided some final artistic touches, and is included in a manuscript which is in review in the Annual Reviews of Environment and Resources as of November, 2021 <sup>7</sup>.

Figure 11. A version of Fig. 10 which I created, prior to Victor Leshyk's contributions. This plot was created using ggplot2, but required a non-standard approach, because ggplot2 does not have built in functionality to add pie charts in place of points. This required creating a list of pie charts with the appropriate x and y information to be added to the underlying gradient.
