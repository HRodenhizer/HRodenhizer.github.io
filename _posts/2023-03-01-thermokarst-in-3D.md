\#30DayMapChallenge
======
The [\#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) is a neat event that has been taking place every November since 2019. If you haven't heard of it before, check it out! The idea is to make a map every day and post it to twitter. While I didn't motivate to complete the challenge on my own, I did contribute to the Woodwell Climate combined \#30DayMapChallenge effort. It was a lot of fun and, in the process, I learned about a cool R package, *rayshader*, which allows all sorts of 3D visualization.

Retrogressive Thaw Slumps
======
Retrogressive thaw slumps are a form of abrupt permafrost thaw responsible for releasing CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. They form on hillslopes when ground ice melt causes the ground to collapse such that a vertical headwall forms. As this headwall continues to melt and retreat up the hill, the retrogressive thaw slump expands. These features are an ideal landform to explore 3D mapping with, given their 3D structure, and can be found in many areas in the Arctic. This video shows a retrogressive thaw slump on the Yamal Peninsula in Siberia.

Retrogressive Thaw Slumps are a form of abrupt permafrost thaw responsible for releasing CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. Wide-spread and newly formed Retrogressive Thaw Slumps are abundant in the Yamal and Gydan region of Siberia.
